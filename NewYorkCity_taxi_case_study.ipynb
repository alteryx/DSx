Once you have downloaded this archive, unzip it and cd into the directory from the command line. Next run the command ``./install_osx.sh`` if you are on a mac or ``./install_linux.sh`` if you are on linux. This should install all of the dependencies.</p>\n",

On Mac and Linux, navigate to the directory that you downloaded from git and run ``jupyter notebook`` to be taken to this notebook in your default web browser. When you open the NewYorkCity_taxi_case_study.ipynb file in the web browser, you can step through the code by clicking the ``Run`` button at the top of the page.
